### Think OS Chapter 8 reading questions

**Multitasking**

1) What is the kernel's most basic task?

2) When an interrupt occurs, what part of the hardware state is saved by hardware?

3) What is the difference between an interrupt and a context switch?

4) Give an example of an event that might cause a process to move from the blocked to the ready state.

5) Why might a scheduler want to give higher priority to an I/O bound process?

6) When I make French toast, I usually make a batch of 12 slices.  But my griddle only has room for 8 slices. 
Each piece of toast has to cook for 5 minutes on each side.  How can I schedule 12 slices onto 8 "cores"
to minimize the elapsed time to cook all 12 slices?  (Note: this question is not hypothetical; 
this is really how I make French toast.)
