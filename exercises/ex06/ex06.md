# Exercise 6

## Linked lists

1) In this directory, you should find `list.c`, which contains an
implementation of a linked list, with some incomplete functions.
Read through the code and draw diagrams representing the lists in
the example, until you are satisfied that you understand the code.

Notice that a list is represented by a pointer-to-pointer-to-Node,
which makes it possible for a function to remove or replace the
first Node in a list.

2) Compile and run `list.c`.

3) Fill in `push()` and test.

4) Fill in `remove_by_value()` and test.

5) Fill in `reverse()` and test.  This one is a very common interview
question.

6) Check in your modified version of `list.c`.


## Valgrind

1) Install Valgrind and Valkyrie

```
    sudo apt-get install valgrind valkyrie
```

Or on a Mac

```
    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
    brew install valgrind
```

2) In this directory, `mem_errors.c` contains every bad thing you can
do with memory (that I could think of).  Use Valgrind (and error
messages from the compiler and runtime system) to find and fix the
errors.
