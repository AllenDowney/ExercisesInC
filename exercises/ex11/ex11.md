Reading: Chapter 11 of *Head First C*.

1) Read, compile and run `advice_server.c`, which is the example from

3) Read, compile and run `wiki_client.c`, which is based on the

client that connects to `advice_server` and prints a reply.

5) Read, compile and run `ikkp_server.c`, which is based on the
example in on page 483.

6) In another window, use `telnet` to connect to `ikkp_server`, as on page 484.
