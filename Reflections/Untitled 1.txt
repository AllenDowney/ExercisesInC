PERSONAL LEARNING GOALS

My personal learning goals for this first chunk of sprints is to really get a grasp on C as well as how and where it is implemented. So far, I think it is going pretty well; I have been able to stay up to date on the readings and exercises and I have understood them for the most part. Additionally, my team formed around the premise that we were all completely new to C and wanted to take on a project of reasonable scope for our current understanding. We chose to work on a project that would implement threading in Arduino. I think that with the team all being on the same page and our project being of reasonable scope will allow me to learn a lot during these first three sprints without being completely overloaded with work.
