# Exercise 3
## Creating small tools


1) Read [the man page for the UNIX command tee](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tee.1.html).  
And [the Wikipedia page about it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command)).

2) Write an implementation of `tee` as described in the man page.  You should implement the `-a` option, but you don't have to implement the other options.  As an extra fun bonus, you could also implement the long-form `--append` option.

This is meant as an exercise in efficient C development, which includes:

* Problem decomposition: what pieces do I need?

* Solution location: mostly Google->stackoverflow.

* Assimilation: bringing in the pieces and testing them.

* Integration: putting the pieces together. 

For this particular problem, we could just find a solution.  But let's take the opportunity to practice.

3) Reflect: what worked, what slowed you down?  What would you do differently next time?

4) Compare your solution to [this professional implementation](https://opensource.apple.com/source/shell_cmds/shell_cmds-170/tee/tee.c) or [this one](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;a=blob;f=src/tee.c;h=5f04bfc86243911be2fb22c7c28447ae6fb0f993;hb=75aababed45d0120d44baa76c5107d0ceb71fc59).  What do you see in professional code that is not in your solution?

5) Write comments in your code to answer the last two questions, then check it in to the repo.
