# Exercise 9
## Fork and exec

Reading: Chapter 9 of *Head First C*.

On 398, I think the book confuses two very different things:

1) A system call, which is similar to a function call, but an
application causes an exception in order to jump into kernel code.  An
interrupt handler executes code (in kernel mode) on behalf of the
process, then jumps back into the application code.

2) The C library function `system()` spawns a child process and uses it
to execute a shell command, which spawns a child process to execute
the command.

These two things are not the same.

`fork` and `exec` are used to spawn child processes:

1) fork creates a child process that is identical to the parent,
except for the pid.

2) exec loads a new program and starts executing it.

Why do we care:

1) Ultimately, this is how all processes are created.  It's the theory
of universal descent for processes.

2) It's how shells work.  You could write one in 10s of lines.

3) For applications, spawning concurrent processes is an alternative
to spawning concurrent threads.

There are a few use cases for using `fork` and `exec` separately, but the
most common use case, spawning a child process, uses both.

1) In this directory, read fork.c, then compile and run with different
numbers of child processes:

```
    gcc -Wall -o fork fork.c
    
    ./fork 1
    
    ./fork 2
    
    ./fork 3
```

Add a comment to `fork.c` that presents and explains the output.

2) Add code to this example to check whether the parent
and child threads share the same static and heap segments.
Add a comment that presents and explains the results.

3) Check `fork.c` in to the repo.
