TROUT is a simple version of traceroute.

It is based on code written by W. Richard Stevens and published in
"UNIX Network Programming Volume 1, Second Edition Networking APIs:
Sockets and XTI," Prentice Hall PTR, Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458.

It has been modified a fair amount by Allen Downey
(downey@colby.edu).  Among other things, I did the following

1) I collected all the procedures from Stevens's extensive library
   and put them in util.c, and put their prototypes in trout.h

2) I killed all the IPv6 support, because I didn't need it and
   because I hate ifdefs and pointers to functions.

3) For the same reason, I took out some of the configuration
   ifdefs.  As a result, I don't know if this will still run
   on anything other than Linux.

4) I fixed a race condition that may or may not have been the
   cause of some early problems I had.  Anyway, the fix also
   came from Stevens, in Section 18.5 of Unix Network Programming.

5) I split things up into more procedures.
