# Exercise 10
## Signal handlers

Before we get to the exercise, I want to clear up a possible area of
confusion: signal handlers are similar to interrupt handlers, but with
a few important differences.

* Signal handlers are application-level code.  Interrupt handlers are
kernel-level code.

* Handling a signal involves a break in the usual flow of execution,
but it does not involve switching from user code to kernel code.

* You can think of a signal handler as if it runs in another thread.
You can call functions (as if you had your own stack), and you can
access the heap, static, and text segments.  But that means you have
to worry about concurrent access to shared variables.

If you call a function, it might crash if it is not reentrant.  Or it
might do something funny like print:

```
    Knock, knock.
    Who's there?
    Interrupting cow.
    InterruOUTPUT FROM SIGNAL HANDLERpting cow who?
```

In one common pattern, the signal handler just sets a flag and
returns.  When the program resumes it (eventually) sees that the flag
is set and responds accordingly.



1) In this directory, read `signal_example.c`, then compile and run it.

2) Modify the program so that if the alarm goes off, you get to answer
one more question before it quits.

3) Check your modified version in to the repo.
