# Exercise 9

Reading: Chapter 9 of *Head First C*.

## Fork and exec

`fork` and `exec` are used to spawn child processes:

* `fork` creates a child process that is identical to the parent,
except for the pid.

* `exec` loads a new program and starts executing it.

Why do we care:

* Ultimately, this is how all processes are created.  It's the theory
of universal descent for processes.

* It's how shells work.  You could write one in 10s of lines.

* For applications, spawning concurrent processes is an alternative
to spawning concurrent threads.

There are a few use cases for using `fork` and `exec` separately, but the
most common use case, spawning a child process, uses both.

1) In this directory, read fork.c, then compile and run with different
numbers of child processes:

```
    gcc -Wall -o fork fork.c
    
    ./fork 1
    
    ./fork 2
    
    ./fork 3
```

Draw a thread diagram that shows the execution of this program with 3 child
processes.

2) Add code to this example to check whether the parent
and child processes share the same global, heap, and stack segments.
Add a comment that presents and explains the results.

See if you can figure out a way to check whether the child
processes share the same code and static segments.

3) Check `fork.c` in to the repo.


## Newshound

In this directory, you'll find `newshound.c`, which contains the code from
page 418 of *Head First C*, with a few style changes.

1) Read the code to make sure you understand it, then compile and run it.

```
    gcc newshound.c
    ./a.out ""
```

Notice that the program has the location of the Python interpreter "hard coded".
If your interpreter is somewhere else, you might have to change that.

If you don't have a Python 2 interpreter, you can use Python 3, but in that case
you should run `rssgossip3.py`.

As the book says, it only prints articles from the first RSS feed, not the
others.  Why?

2) Add code to fork one process for each feed, so you have five instances
of `rssgossip.py` running concurrently.  Confirm that the program now gets
articles from all five feeds.

3) Add code so that the parent thread waits for the child processes to complete,
checks for errors, and then exits.

4) Check in your modified version of `newshound.c`.
