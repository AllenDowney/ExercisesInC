### Think OS Chapter 5 reading questions

**Bits and bytes**

1) Suppose you have the value 128 stored as an unsigned 8-bit number.  What happens if you convert 
it to a 16-bit number and accidentally apply sign extension?

2) Write a C expression that computes the two's complement of 12 using the XOR bitwise operator. 
Try it out and confirm that the result is interpreted as -12.

3) Can you guess why IEEE floating-point uses biased integers to represent the exponent rather than a
sign bit or two's complement?

4) Following the example in Section 5.3, write the 32-bit binary representation of -13 in single precision 
IEEE floating-point.  What would you get if you accidentally interpreted this value as an integer?

5) Write a function that takes a string and converts from lower-case to upper-case by flipping the sixth bit.  
As a challenge, you can make a faster version by reading the string 32 or 64 bits at a time, rather than one
character at a time.  This optimization is made easier if the length of the string is a multiple of 4 or 8 bytes.
